    <h3>Persistence and Passion</h3>
    
    <p>There is a reason this requirement was placed in the beginning of this article. 
        Persistence and passion aren’t things 
        <br>
        that can be taught; they both have to come from you. 
        Many people want to get into front end developing; a want is not a burning desire.  
    </p>
    <p>Becoming a front-end developer requires a strong passion for building beautiful, 
        responsive, and efficient applications.
         <br>
         Your persistence to overcome challenges and 
         setbacks should be fueled by your passion to succeed as a web developer. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Mistakes To Avoid</h3>
   
    <p>
        Courses are a great way to get a general idea of how a language or framework works.
         However, it’s easy to get caught up in 
         <br>
         watching hours of material, without retaining 
         much information. It is essential that you write every line of code that 
         <br>
         an instructor 
         writes in order for you to completely understand what’s going on. 
    </p>

    <p>
        DO NOT go on auto piolet when writing code from a course. 
        You need to internalize and understand what the purpose of each line is. 
        <br>
        If you get confused, go back, comment on the video, google, or search 
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">
            stack overflow.
        </a>
       
    </p>

    <h3>The Only Way to Truly Learn </h3>

    <br>

    <h5>Guided Tutorials!</h5>
    <p>
        Guided tutorials are a great way to truly grasp the real-world application 
        of a certain programming language or concept. 
        <br>
        For example,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDgEqoQUBgk" target="_blank">
            building an Instagram 
            clone with react 
        </a>
        , or 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=4s" target="_blank">
            15 vanilla JavaScript projects 
        </a>
        are both good examples of
        <br> 
        the types of videos you should look for,
        for whatever language you’re aiming to master. 
    </p>

    <h5>Challenge Yourself!</h5>

    <p>
        Recreate websites and/or web apps on your own! 
        Try and recreate the websites you made in the guided tutorials without 
        <br>
        looking at the videos. 
        If you get stuck use Google and Stack Overflow before looking back at the original 
        guided tutorial video.
        <br>
         You can also refer to websites like 
        <a href="https://devchallenges.io/paths/front-end-developer" target="_blank">
            decChallenges
        </a>
        to practice building from scratch.
