    <h3>Requirements:</h3>
    <br>
    <li>Understand How to Prioritize</li>
    <li>Use the 3 goals per day rule</li>
    <li>Plan While Understanding Yourself</li>
    <li>Use the 5 Minute Rule to Build a New Habit</li>
    <br>
    <h3>Use the 3 Goals Per Day Rule</h3>
    <p>When you wake up, list out a maximum of three important and achievable goals. 
        We often overestimate our 
        <br>
        level of energy which can result in burn out.
         When creating your list, you should look at these items and think to yourself,
         <br> 
         “this doesn’t seem so bad. I can accomplish these three things today pretty easily.” 
    </p>

    <p>Choose whichever tool you would like to write down these 3 items. 
        I personally use reminders on my iPhone and display the 
        <br>
        three items on the first page 
        of my home screen using Apple’s widgets Whatever tool you choose, make sure you choose a 
        <br>
        tool that you always have access to, understand how to use, and doesn’t cause you to spend 
        an unreasonable amount of time.
    </p>

    <h3>Plan While Understanding Yourself</h3>
    <p>It’s easy to say “I will spend 3 hours every day working on X side project,” 
        while you’re working full time, have 
        <br>
        chores, and other 
        responsibilities; it’s hard to 
        actually execute. 
    </p>

    <p> To stay true to your schedule, give yourself buffer time and understand how you operate. 
        Use a tool that
        <br>
         allows you to easily schedule your days. I use a mixture of
        <a href="https://calendar.google.com" target="_blank">
            Google Calendar 
        </a> and 
        <a href="https://outlook.office.com" target="_blank">
            Outlook.
        </a>
        When I plan my days,
        <br>
         I try to give myself a lot of buffer time in between important tasks. 
    </p>

    <h3>Use the 5 Minute Rule to Build a New Habit</h3>
    
    <p>Telling yourself that you will spend only 5 minutes doing something 
        is a good way to get yourself to start a task.
        <br>
         By doing so, you encourage yourself 
        to get started, without feeling intimidated; after all, it’s only 5 minutes! 
        <br>
        You’ll find yourself spending more than 5 minutes. There will be days where you 
        cannot go longer than 5.
        <br>
         However, by doing it every day you’re forming a habit that 
        will help you stay consistent. Consistency is the key!
